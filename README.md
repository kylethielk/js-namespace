Welcome to js-namespace
=======================

js-namespace is a simple javascript 'class' designed to simply the iniatilization and use of namespaces in javascript.

Javascript does not have a built in syntax for namespaces so we have to implement them ourselves. I have tried many different approaches for namespaces and this project serves to demonstrate the one I've found most effective.
